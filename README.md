# WORED (wordle clone)

I was inspired by [Jessica's](https://github.com/jvlazar) wordle replica project, so I decided to implement one myself.
The only reference I had was the fact that I've played wordle before.

Unlike wordle, wored offers a few additions to the normal game.

- You can change the amount of attempts. Minimum is 1, maximum 16
- You can change the length of the word. Minimum is 3 letters, maximum is 12
